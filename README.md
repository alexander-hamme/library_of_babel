# library_of_babel
An interactive game to teach incoming Bard College freshmen how to integrate computer coding into their own writing. In addition to programming, I engineered the soundtrack and all sound effects. 

In order to view the actual Twine code, download the HTML file and import it as a new project on [Twine](https://twinery.org/2/).

Technologies used: Twine software, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
